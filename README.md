AWS WPF S3 Access project
-----------------------------

The intent of this project is to create a simple UI interface for the AWS S3 buckets


I am using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2017 for creating and maintaining the security profile. With this, I don't have to store the access keys in a publicly accessible file. This also ensures that the keys don't get uploaded to Github :)
